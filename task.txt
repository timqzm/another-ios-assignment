The task is about refactoring: at some point we had to get rid of UIAlertView
which was used all around our code base. We are interested to see how you would 
have done it, considering that we would like to: 


Replace UIAlertView with newer
version from apple or any other library
Have generic interface for that dialog, which we could later could be wired up to any third party AlertView on market, if the one you choose also gets deprecated
Minimum changes in the calling class.


Original code (see attachment) is in objective-c, but you are free to try to combine it with swift. Bonus points
for clean code:)
